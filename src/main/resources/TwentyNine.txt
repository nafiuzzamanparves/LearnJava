1. Bank Account Management System
•	OOP Concepts:
    o	Classes: BankAccount, SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount (Inheritance)
    o	Encapsulation: Private attributes (account number, balance, etc.) with public getters and setters
    o	Polymorphism: Overridden methods for deposit, withdrawal, and calculating interest in subclasses
•	Exception Handling:
    o	InsufficientFundsException to be thrown when withdrawal exceeds balance
    o	InvalidAmountException to be thrown for invalid deposit/withdrawal amounts (e.g., negative values)
•	File I/O:
    o	Read initial account information from a file (e.g., CSV)
    o	Write updated account information to a file after transactions
